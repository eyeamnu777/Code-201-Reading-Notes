These topics matter because the previous lab asked for a nice visualization to be presented.


## What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?
Allows coders to draw two dimensional graphics using JS.


## What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?
 Anything within the tags serve as fallback content in case a browser doesnt support the element (basically a backup option) and requires the closing tag </canvas>

## Explain what the getContext() method does.

 The getContext takes one argument (the type of drawing context).

// Chart.js Documentation:
## What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

Chart.js is a JS plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw three different types of graphs onto the page.

## List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

pie line and bar chart

## What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

It would be helpful for screen readers and it's easier to catch a reader's eye- by providing a visual.


## How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
Odd Duck Product Co preferred a graph for visualization purposes.


##Things I want to learn more about:
is this what the next lab (12) be about? hmm i wonder.

Leanred about how Chart.js offer different formats to pratice with and problem sold like documents.
