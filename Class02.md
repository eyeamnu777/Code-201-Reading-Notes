# Class 02 Reading Notes

## Author: Nù

## How did this go, overall?

Went pretty well after going over concepts written down, rewritten, and using the class lab examples to fill the rest of the void.

## What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

The only part I got caught up on is storing my progress and syncing with the repo's I have on Git.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

Altogether I would say the assignment took a total of 4 hours to complete since I had to understand concepts and reasons for certain elements and invocation. I did not assume how long it would take since I am farther behind than the class.
