## What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
A CSS transform property allows an element to be rotated, translated, scaled and skewed going off of axis x, y, and z.


## Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
When a clicker hovers over the content and it has the zoom in property appearing to get bigger as the mouse hovers over. Can be used when going through different tabs on a website.


## What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
CSS transition allows the altering the appearance and behavior of an element when it is :hover, :target, :active, or :focus -- can only animate between a start and end state and controlled by existing CSS property values. 
-visually more gradual and smooth


## How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition? 
Animation has more control the ability to set multiple points of transiton in different keyframes. 
- defines intermediate states as well as beginning and ending states unlike transitions

## What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
creates an attention grabber and site engagement even with the most simple transitions -- more smooth look; the "grease" for transitions .(reference: #3)

## How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
Would provide beginner animation qualities to site for project week.


# Things I want to know 
I am looking forward to reading and learning more about keyframes as they relate to videography and the current era of content. May this concept won't be too unfamiliar for me because keyframes in video software works in a wonky kind of way yet add simple ways to catch anyone's attention-- keyframes are like zoom in and movement from one side of the frame to the other.
