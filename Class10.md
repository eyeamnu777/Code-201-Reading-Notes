# CLASS 10- BUGGING 

## 1) Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax Errors are errors based on misspelling where logic error is  due the code gives incorrect results with the a correct syntax.

## 2) List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I have experienced a syntax error a couple of times where I was missing the S in elements and it was fixed by starting by the closest ancestor line of code.

## 3) How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

It points more in the direction of possible error types and location and tells one what to look for, and not to panic when red is seen.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger is like similar to a bouncer at a busy night club, watching over values and where they may break down, not letting the problem get through.

## Define what a breakpoint is.

a breakpoint is the point where it simply serves as an alarm for the debugger to step in and clarify what type of error it may be. 
    - when the bugger demands a prompt to the coder (inputNewItem)

## What is the call stack?

Call stack is a section showing what code was executed to get to the current line and can only be used while code is running.
